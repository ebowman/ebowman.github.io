    <h1>FlöBreath Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>FlöBreath is a guided breathing and heart rate variability (HRV) app. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the app accesses and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Health Data</h2>
    <p>FlöBreath uses Apple HealthKit to read the following data during breathing sessions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heart rate</strong> — to show your heart rate trend during and after sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Heart rate variability (HRV)</strong> — to measure your HRV response to breathing exercises</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This health data is used solely to provide you with session feedback and personal insights within the app.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data collected by FlöBreath is stored locally on your device. Session history, heart rate samples, and HRV measurements remain on your iPhone and Apple Watch. <strong>No health data is transmitted to any server, third party, or cloud service.</strong></p>

    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>FlöBreath does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal information such as your name or email address.</p>

    <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
    <p>FlöBreath does not include any analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or tracking tools. We do not collect usage data, crash reports, or device identifiers.</p>

    <h2>No Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, share, or transfer your data to any third parties. Your health data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete individual session records within the app by swiping left on any session in your history. Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data. Health data written to Apple Health can be managed through the Health app.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>FlöBreath is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we update this privacy policy, we will post the revised version on this page with an updated date.</p>

	<p style="padding-left: 20pt">The minute you express an idea in writing, it tends to take on the most
  extraordinary beauty. It appears to have been chiseled in gold, making you
  reluctant to revise it if necessary. Consequently, try not to begin by just
  dictating the whole document "to get it all down," on the assumption that you
  can ﬁgure out the structure more easily afterwards. The chances are you'll
  love it once you see it typed, no matter how disjointed the thinking really is.</p>
